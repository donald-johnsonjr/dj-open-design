# Color craft rules

Universal color rules applied on top of the active `DESIGN.md`. The
design system supplies the palette tokens; this file enforces how to
*use* them.

> Adapted from [refero_skill](https://github.com/referodesign/refero_skill)
> (MIT). All examples reference Open Design's standard tokens
> (`--bg`, `--surface`, `--fg`, `--muted`, `--border`, `--accent`).

## Palette structure

A coherent palette has four layers. Plan all four before writing any CSS.

| Layer | Share of pixels | Tokens |
|---|---|---|
| **Neutrals** | 70–90% | `--bg`, `--surface`, `--fg`, `--muted`, `--border` |
| **Accent** (one) | 5–10% | `--accent` only — never invent a second accent |
| **Semantic** | 0–5% | `--success`, `--warn`, `--danger` |
| **Effect** | <1% | gradients, glows; rarely justified |

## Accent discipline

The single biggest readability failure in AI-generated UIs is accent
overuse. Hard caps:

- **At most 2 visible uses of `--accent` per screen.** Typical pair:
  one eyebrow / chip + one primary CTA. Or one accent card + one tab
  pill. Pick a pair, not a flood.
- Links count as accent; demote to `--fg` underline if you also have a
  CTA on the same screen.
- Hover/focus rings count as accent. Ration accordingly.

## The neutral ramp carries the design

70–90% of pixels are neutral, so the neutrals are the design — not the
accent. Build a real ramp with intentional steps, not one grey lightened
by opacity:

- Aim for **5–7 neutral steps** between `--bg` and `--fg` (background,
  surface, subtle border, strong border, muted text, secondary text,
  foreground). Even spacing in perceptual lightness reads as considered.
- Derive borders and dividers from the ramp, not from `--accent`. A
  hairline `--border` all-round beats a colored edge.
- Don't fake depth with a stack of near-identical greys. If two surfaces
  are one step apart and never adjacent, collapse them.

## Interaction states are derived, not invented

Hover/active/selected colors must come from the existing tokens, never a
new hand-picked hue:

- **Hover** — shift one ramp step (surface → subtle) or overlay
  `color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 8%, transparent)`. Don't jump to a
  brighter unrelated color.
- **Active/pressed** — one step darker/more-saturated than hover, plus
  the 2px motion from `animation-discipline.md` if it's a button.
- **Selected** — a low-alpha accent tint fill, not a full-saturation
  accent block, unless it's the single primary action.
- **Disabled** — reduce to a muted neutral; never keep accent color on a
  disabled control.

## Contrast minimums

Run these as gates, not goals:

| Pair | Minimum |
|---|---|
| Body text (≤16 px) on background | **4.5:1** |
| Large text (>18 px or 14 px bold) | **3:1** |
| UI components against adjacent surfaces | **3:1** |

When the brand color clashes (low-contrast indigo on light background is
common), darken the accent to a `600`-level shade for text use; reserve
the brand-bright variant for fills only.

## Dark themes

Avoid pure black and pure white — both cause vibration and eye strain.

| Token | Dark theme | Light theme |
|---|---|---|
| Background | `#0f0f0f` (not `#000`) | `#fafafa` (not `#fff`) |
| Foreground | `#f0f0f0` (not `#fff`) | `#111111` (not `#000`) |

On dark surfaces, prefer **semi-transparent white borders** over solid
dark borders — a 1px `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` reads as structure
without adding visual noise.

## Semantic color naming

Always name tokens by **purpose**, never by hue:

```css
/* good */
--accent: #2f6feb;
--success: #17a34a;

/* bad — locks you out of theming */
--blue-500: #2f6feb;
--green-500: #17a34a;
```

## Anti-defaults

- **Indigo `#6366f1`** (Tailwind `indigo-500`) is the most reliable
  AI-slop tell. The active `DESIGN.md` provides `--accent`; use it. If
  the brief truly needs indigo, make the user say so explicitly. If
  your `DESIGN.md` encodes indigo as `--accent`, that is intentional —
  the linter only flags hardcoded hex, so `var(--accent)` uses are
  unaffected even when the resolved color happens to be `#6366f1`.
- **Two-stop "trust" gradient** (purple → blue, blue → cyan, etc.) on a
  hero is the second most reliable tell. A flat surface + one
  type-driven hierarchy beats it every time.
- **Decorative gradients with no functional purpose**. Gradients should
  separate hierarchies (header → body, primary CTA → secondary), not
  decorate empty space.
